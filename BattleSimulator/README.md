# Battle For The Country

## Project Description
---
This is Battle For The Country, a turn-based battle game where you create custom characters and have them fight in turn-based battles. Characters can save inbetween runs of the game and they can level up, allowing them to achieve higher stats. This serves as a spin-off from my previous game, Quest For The Country. It is recommended to play this game with two players.  

## Installations
---
Does not need to be done. 

## Execution and Usage
---
This program is a two-player video game. It is intended to be played with two players on the same computer, taking turns on the computer to take turns in game. It is also a python program so it needs python to run.

This is what the game should look like upon starting it if you do not have two or more characters saved:

## Author's Info

I am Darius Vaiaoga, a student of Ms. LaRose's Computer Programming 2 class. I have always had a passion for programming, learning it when I was 7 years old. Specifically, I have a passion for game design and I aspire to complete a proper game one day, but any programming is good programming. I also hold passions for history and astronomy. My primary hobbies are learning about history and playing video games.
